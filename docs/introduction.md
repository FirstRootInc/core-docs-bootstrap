Welcome to the FirstRoot GraphQL API documentation. 

The [GraphQL query language](https://www.graphql.com/) provides a complete and understandable description of the data in our API. This is commonly organized in terms of types and fields, this means that all the data can be accessed through a single endpoint.

A GraphQL callâ€™s structure is similar to the JSON data it returns; Nested fields will allow you to query for specific data your app requires through a single request.

[GraphQL playground](explorer-guide.md) will enable you to easily view at the [FirstRoot API Schema](references.md) including the reference documentation of the queries and mutations.

Additionally, we have linked several other [GraphQL resources](graphql.md) so you can get familiar with this language and continue learning how it works.
