Welcome to the Firstroot GraphQL API documentation.

To learn more about FirstRoot and what Participatory Budgeting is, visite our resources section on our website. [Take me there!](https://firstroot.co/teacher-resources/)

The [GraphQL query language](https://www.graphql.com/) provides a complete and understandable description of the data in our API. This is commonly organized in terms of types and fields, this means that all the data can be accessed through a single endpoint.
A GraphQL callâ€™s structure is similar to the JSON data it returns; Nested fields will allow you to query for specific data your app requires through a single request.

Integrate [Participatory Budgeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI3_KWBWXSE) in your web or mobile application; [Our schema](/api/schema) includes all the features our API supports. 

We provide some [guides](pbcycle) that cover some core concepts to help with bulidng your integration.
