Welcome to the FirstRoot API documentation portal where youâ€™ll find all necessary infomation about our Participatory Budgeting App. 

The FirstRoot API is a GraphQL API. The [GraphQL query language](https://graphql.org/learn/) provides a complete and understandable description of the data in our API. 

GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, so all the data is accessed through a single endpoint.
A GraphQL call's structure is similar to the JSON data it returns. Nested fields let you query for specific data your app requires in a single request.

Using [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) you can easily view the [FirstRoot API schema](references.md) including the reference documentation of the queries and mutations.

We linked more great ressources to get familiar with and learn GraphQL [here](graphql.md).
