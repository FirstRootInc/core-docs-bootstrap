Feel free to download our public schema for the FirstRoot GraphQL API [here](http://api-staging.firstroot.co/graphiql).

[GraphQL playground](explorer-guide.md) will enable you to easily view at the FirstRoot API Schema including the reference documentation of the queries and mutations and test them.

Visit [GraphQL Voyager](explorer-guide-2) to visually explore FirstRoot APIâ€™s interactive graph.

Additionally, we have linked several other [GraphQL resources](graphql.md) so you can get familiar with this language and continue learning how it works.
